Note to Codex: This text file contains the output of 3 previous queries (to Codex) to derive the structure and function of the "Aider" code repository.

Using the combined knowledge (existing docs, this query output, and agent scaffolding) update the documentation.

Repository structure

CNAME            LICENSE.txt  aider      pyproject.toml  requirements.txt

aider/ – main package containing CLI entrypoint, command handling, Git integration, model management, etc.
benchmark/ – harness for running Exercism‑based benchmarks against various LLMs.
tests/ – Python unit tests for most functionality (CLI, models, repo handling, etc.).
The project is distributed as the aider-chat package. The executable entry point is defined in pyproject.toml:

[project.scripts]
aider = "aider.main:main"

Key modules

CLI & argument parsing: aider/main.py orchestrates program startup, loading configuration files, initializing LLM models, handling Git setup, and running the main Coder loop. Command‑line arguments are defined in aider/args.py with ConfigArgParse and support environment files and many options.
Coders: aider/coders/ implements the logic for generating and applying code edits. base_coder.py provides the common behavior and other coders such as ArchitectCoder extend it for different chat modes.
Git integration: aider/repo.py wraps GitPython to commit changes, handle attribution options, and build diffs.
Model management: aider/models.py describes model metadata, handles aliases, and integrates with litellm for API calls. aider/llm.py lazily loads the litellm library.
File watching: aider/watch.py can monitor the filesystem for comments marked with “AI!” or “AI?” to trigger automatic actions.
Voice & help: modules like voice.py and help.py integrate optional speech‑to‑text and offline documentation search.
Onboarding: aider/onboarding.py selects a default model based on available API keys or triggers OpenRouter OAuth if none are found.
Features from the README

The README lists core capabilities such as connecting to many LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, etc.), building a “map” of your codebase, supporting 100+ languages, Git integration, IDE workflows, image & web context, voice-to-code, automatic linting & testing, and copy/paste workflow for web chat. See the “Features” section for details.

Getting started

Installation is via pip:

python -m pip install aider-install
aider-install
aider --model deepseek --api-key deepseek=<key>

What to explore next

Understand the Coder class hierarchy – starting with base_coder.py to learn how prompts are built, messages are streamed, and code edits are applied.
Examine repo.py for how Aider stages and commits changes, manages attribution flags, and generates commit messages.
Explore models.py to see how model aliases and metadata are loaded, how context windows and prices are fetched, and how API calls are made via litellm.
Look into onboarding.py to understand how default models are chosen and how OAuth is implemented for OpenRouter.
Run or read the unit tests in tests/ to see practical usage and edge cases.
Check the benchmark directory if you want to evaluate LLM performance using Exercism exercises.
This repository provides a fairly complete implementation of an AI pair‑programming CLI with extensive Git integration, configuration options, and support for multiple LLM providers. The documentation (README.md and aider/website/) and tests will help deepen your understanding of individual components.

graph TD
    A[aider.main] --> B[Coder.create]
    B --> C[RepoMap]
    B --> D[GitRepo]

    B --> F[InputOutput]
    B --> G[Model]
    D --> H[gitpython]
    F --> I[chat_history.md]
This flow shows aider.main building a Coder, which in turn coordinates repository summaries (RepoMap), Git commits (GitRepo), chat summarization (ChatSummary), terminal I/O (InputOutput), and model calls (Model).

Memory and cost management
Coder tracks total tokens sent and received, plus per-message costs. When the LLM signals a context‑window error or partial reply (FinishReasonLength), it warns the user and may attempt to resume if the model supports partial continuation.
Model provides a token_count method using litellm tokenizers so the application can estimate usage before sending prompts or images.
Overall, Aider organizes an interactive coding session around the Coder class, providing Git traceability, automatic history summarization, and flexible model selection. The design balances context preservation (via chat logs and repo maps) with token budgets by summarizing past interactions and verifying message sizes before sending.
