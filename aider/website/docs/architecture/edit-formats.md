# Edit formats

Aider can apply changes in several formats: whole file, diff, diff-fenced, udiff
and the simplified editor-* variants used when an architect model proposes edits.
The main model's metadata specifies its preferred format, but users can override
with `--edit-format`.

See [Edit formats](../more/edit-formats.html) for detailed examples of each style
and how they influence prompt design.
